## Notes for Those Who Want to Use This Code for the ICG HW1 Assignment

- **Please only refer to the implementation approach and do not use the code directly.**  
  This (older) version of the code has been shared with many people, and they may have continued to circulate it. I am not certain whether the professor or TAs have already become familiar with it.

- **Additionally, the audio effect feature was not covered in the course.**  
  I learned how to implement it from [Prof. Chun-Fa Chang](https://chunfa.org/)'s course when studying at NTNU. If you include this feature in your assignment, it will be extremely obvious.

- A screenshot is attached as proof that I took the course in 2020.
